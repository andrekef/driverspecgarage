        <p>
            Our Ceramic Coating service is designed to restore and protect your vehicle's finish. The process starts with a complete decontamination wash to remove embedded contaminants such as industrial fallout, brake dust, tar, and tree sap. Following this, we perform a 2-Step Machine Paint Correction (Cut & Polish) to eliminate swirls, scratches, hazing, etchings, and other imperfections, bringing your vehicle's finish to a high standard.
        </p>
        <p>
            We apply 1 layer of Gtechniq Crystal Serum Light (CSL) followed by 2 layers of Gtechniq EXO v5. This combination provides exceptional protection, adding depth and gloss while safeguarding against elements such as brake dust, salt, UV exposure, contaminants, chemicals, and bird droppingsâ€”assuming proper maintenance.
